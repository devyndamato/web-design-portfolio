  <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a current senior at the University of Denver, majoring in Strategic
    Communications with a Marketing minor. Throughout my time in school and my
    internship experience, I’ve developed a strong passion for public relations,
    from building media relationships to crafting compelling brand stories. As I
    prepare to graduate, I’m excited to continue growing in the PR industry and
    contribute to campaigns that make an impact.
  </p>

  <p>
    I grew up in a suburb of Kansas City on the Kansas side, but I was born in
    Denver, Colorado. Outside of my professional life, I enjoy traveling,
    spending time outdoors, reading, attending live music, and spending time
    with my loved ones.

    This website is part of my journey into learning web development and
    understanding how digital content is structured and published online. I’m
    excited to continue building my skills throughout this course.

  One website I enjoy visiting is

  This is where my current internship is, and I love how the agency maintains a
  consistent theme while using a creative and engaging visual style.
