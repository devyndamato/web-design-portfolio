      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
       I am a current senior at the University of Denver, majoring in Strategic Communications with a Marketing minor. 
       Throughout my time in school and my internship experience, I’ve developed a strong passion for public relations, 
       from building media relationships to crafting compelling brand stories. As I prepare to graduate, I’m excited to
       continue growing in the PR industry and contribute to campaigns that make an impact.
      </p>
      <p>
      Outside of my professional life, I enjoy traveling, spending time outdoors, reading, attending live
      music, and spending time with my loved ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born in Denver but grew up in a suburb of Kansas City, Overland Park, Kansas. Although Kansas may not be the most exciting state, 
        it has tons to offer. My favorite things about Kansas City are the amazing barbeque, little to no traffic!, home cooked meals from my 
        parents, and how green everything is. I never realized how green nature is until I came home after my first year at DU.
