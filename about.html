        <div class="about-text">
          <p>
            I am a current senior at the University of Denver, majoring in Strategic Communications with a Marketing minor.
            Throughout my time in school and through my internship experience, I have developed a strong passion for public relations,
            from building media relationships to crafting compelling brand stories. As I prepare to graduate, I am excited to continue
            growing in the PR industry and to contribute to campaigns that make an impact.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was born in Denver but grew up in Overland Park, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.
            Some of my favorite things about Kansas City are the amazing barbecue, little to no traffic,
            home-cooked meals from my parents, and how green everything is.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of my professional life, I enjoy traveling, spending time outdoors, reading, and attending live music.
            I love finding new places to explore, whether that is in a new city or somewhere close to home.
            Getting outside and being active helps me reset, and reading is one of my favorite ways to unwind.
